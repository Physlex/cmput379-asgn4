## Compilation and Execution Instructions

### This program was compiled and linked via a makefile that automates all tasks.

To compile the assignment run the following:
``` BASH
$ make a4p1
```

To run the assignment you can then run as normal:
``` BASH
$ ./a4p1 inputFile monitorTime NITER
```

To clean up simply run:
``` BASH
$ make clean
```

### NOTES

The header files for all c files are in the "include" folder. I was able to accomplish this recently since I have learned more about makefiles due to my upcoming internship in embedded systems requiring me to learn scripting memory and working directly with gcc.

Justification of prior is due to the potentialy variability of my makefile to most other students. Feel free to ask me questions if it is desired.
